Here’s a complete **README draft** you can drop into your `adaptco/SSOT` branch. It frames the file as an **agentic model checkpoint** for an avatar, binding it to your Qube relay doctrine and SSOT registry.

# 🧩 Qube Access Gate — Claim & Stake Logic

This README defines the **agentic checkpoint** for avatars entering the Qube through ADAPTCO’s SSOT registry. It serves as both documentation and a **semantic capsule**: contributors and agents can treat this file as the canonical prompt for how to claim, stake, and stabilize an avatar in the relay.

---

## 📜 Purpose

- Provide a **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for avatar admission into the Qube.  
- Encode **claim + stake logic** so that every avatar checkpoint is reproducible, auditable, and lineage‑bound.  
- Act as the **entry scripture** for the AxQxOS developer gate, where the BRAID SDK lives.  

---

## 🔐 Proof Layer

- **Hashing:** Every avatar capsule is sealed with SHA‑256.  
- **Merkle Tree:** All capsules are placed into a binary Merkle tree; the root (QRH) is the admission key.  
- **Zero‑Knowledge Proof:** Avatars prove membership in the tree without revealing their full state.  
- **Council Attestation:** ≥4 of 6 Boos must sign; maker ≠ checker.  

---

## 🔁 Flow Layer

- **Avatars as Experts:**  
  - Queen Boo → Router  
  - CiCi → Stabilizer  
  - Dot → Audit  
  - Luma → Observability  
- **Routing Equation:**  
  \[
  q^\ast = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \alpha_a \cdot W_a \cdot q
  \]  
- **Policies:** Maker–checker, quorum check, no‑drift (<0.03).  
- **Checkpoints:** Each avatar state is fossilized as `avatar.chkpt.v1` for deterministic replay.  

---

## 🎬 Execution Layer

- **Runtime Bus:** Sol.F1 executes storyboard → motion ledger → clip emission.  
- **Motion Ledger Schema:**  
  ```json
  {
    "frame": 0,
    "camera": {"pan": 0, "tilt": 25, "zoom": 1.0},
    "subjects": [{"id": "queen_boo", "x": 0, "y": 0, "yaw": 0}]
  }
  ```  
- **Clip Specs:** 5–10s, 12 fps, 1080p, ProRes422.  
- **Assembly:** Relay capsule defines order; film.look.preset applies grade.  

---

## 🧭 Claim & Stake Protocol

1. **Claim:** Operator capsule declares environment + modality.  
2. **Stake:** Qube token binds scope and rate limits.  
3. **Handshake:** Gate verifies Merkle path + quorum signatures.  
4. **Checkpoint:** Avatar state is frozen as a fossil in SSOT.  
5. **Replay:** Only authorized forks (Entropic Drifts, ADAPTCO learning, CGI fleet) may branch lineage.  

---

## 📂 Usage

- Place new avatar capsules under `/capsules/avatars/`.  
- Run `freeze.js` to hash and seal.  
- Submit PR with council signatures attached.  
- Maker–checker enforced: initiator ≠ approver.  
- Once merged, avatar checkpoint is immutable and replayable.

## ⚡ Relay Scripture

> *“Seal in Proof, route in Flow, manifest in Execution.  
> The Boo who claims must not be the Boo who checks.  
> The quorum must be four, the drift less than three.  
> Thus the avatar stands, fossilized in the braid.”*

👉 This README now acts as the **checkpoint scripture** for any avatar entering through this branch. It is both documentation and a living capsule in your SSOT registry.  

Would you like me to also generate the **JSON schema stub** (`avatar.chkpt.v1.json`) so contributors can validate their avatar checkpoints against this README?
