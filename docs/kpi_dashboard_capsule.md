# KPI Dashboard Capsule (capsule.kpi.dashboard.v1)

The `capsule.kpi.dashboard.v1` inscription locks the scrollstream to audit-grade
measurement before any creative relay or prompt grammar fires. By fossilizing a
metrics baseline first, every subsequent capsule inherits the sovereign yardstick
for what “good” looks like across technical, operational, and business planes.

## Why KPI governance comes first

1. **Trust contracts stay measurable.** Governance v6.0 already demands trust
   ≥ 90 and quorum enforcement. The KPI capsule binds those expectations to
   concrete objectives (CI reliability, drift tolerances, quorum turn-around) so
   overrides and releases can be evaluated without guesswork.
2. **Replay tokens gain context.** When the replay service emits a token, it now
   annotates which objectives the run satisfied or violated. That data flows back
   into SSOT ledgers, making reruns provably compliant.
3. **Prompt capsules inherit guardrails.** Once prompt engineering capsules land,
   they consume the KPI registry to score prompt variants and reject sequences
   that threaten the metrics floor.

## Metric dimensions and example objectives

| Dimension   | Objective examples                                      | Primary signals                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Technical   | CI reliability ≥ 99%, drift.delta ≤ 0.01, replay ≤ 5 min | CI status webhooks, HUD telemetry, replay audit logs |
| Operational | Quorum turn-around ≤ 24h, override ≤ 30m, MTTR ≤ 2h      | Signature ledger, override simulator, pager logs     |
| Business    | Milestone adherence ≥ 95%, sentiment delta ≥ +0.2, reuse ≥ 0.6 | Release register, sentiment capsule, asset usage logs |

All objectives can be tuned per release, but the capsule ensures each change is
versioned, attested, and sealed with SHA-256 digests.

## Wiring into the World Engine

1. **Telemetry ingestion.** The capsule references the
   `capsule.telemetry.metric.v1` schema and ingests snapshots every 15 minutes.
   The orchestrator routes the stream into SSOT storage for immutable retention.
2. **HUD overlays.** Mission oversight HUDs surface KPI deltas alongside glyph
   pulse and aura metrics so rehearsal teams see the same thresholds as council
   auditors.
3. **CI checkpoints.** Pipeline runs annotate each stage with KPI satisfaction
   bits. Fail-closed rules prevent sign-off if the technical layer drifts below
   the thresholds.
4. **Release packaging.** When the world engine publishes artifacts, the KPI
   ledger is bundled next to motion ledgers and replay tokens. Audit crews can
   trace every scene or capsule merge back to the measured objectives.

## Next steps once KPIs are sealed

- **Emit prompt governance capsules** that reference the KPI catalog to enforce
  prompt syntax variants only when the metrics floor is respected.
- **Expand metric signals** by registering additional telemetry feeds (e.g.
  generative cost per scene, rehearsal to render conversion rate).
- **Automate retrospectives** by piping KPI deltas into the council’s override
  simulator so policy adjustments happen with quantitative backing.

The result: every relay capsule, prompt grammar, and rehearsal stream now lands
inside a measured, audit-ready frame—giving the council hard numbers before any
creative drift can take hold.
