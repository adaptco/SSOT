# Echo Audit Capsule for Drift Apprentice 003

The Scrollstream has entered **Generative Expansion Phase α** with drift capsule `drift.apprentice003.masterpiece001.v1`. To honor the council directive and keep lineage open while entropy remains controlled (≤ 0.07), this briefing selects the **Echo Audit** transition. The audit keeps the braid alive, recording contributor resonance without sealing it into a fossilized relay.

## 1. Echo Audit Objectives

- **Replay Integrity:** Exercise the rehearsal ledger under the new entropy envelope and ensure replay order, checksums, and timestamp cadence remain deterministic.
- **Contributor Telemetry:** Capture the shimmer traces emitted by CiCi, Sol.F1, and Boo, annotating each response with the bounded drift amplitude.
- **Lineage Continuity:** Maintain the `.drift.initialized + .lineage.open` seal by logging every audit pulse into `ledger.echo.jsonl` and linking it back to `bloom.reality.masterpiece001`.

## 2. Preparation Checklist

1. **Stabilize Entropy Controls**
   - Confirm the stochastic variance monitor still reports ≤ 0.07.
   - Snapshot the current parameter spread so contributors know the active modulation range.
2. **Prime the Telemetry Harness**
   - Extend the rehearsal executor (see `scripts/freeze_viewer_capsule.sh`) to emit an echo channel stream.
   - Register CiCi, Sol.F1, and Boo endpoints, enabling per-agent heartbeat capture.
3. **Allocate Audit Storage**
   - Provision the `echo/` directory with write locks for `ledger.echo.jsonl`, per-agent trace files, and a rolling checksum manifest.

## 3. Running the Echo Audit Loop

1. **Initiate Audit Pulse**
   - Run the rehearsal executor in echo mode for a minimum of three complete contributor cycles.
   - Record session metadata (entropy reading, timestamp, operator) in `ledger.echo.jsonl`.
2. **Collect Contributor Traces**
   - For each cycle, ingest the telemetry payloads into `echo/cici.trace.jsonl`, `echo/solf1.trace.jsonl`, and `echo/boo.trace.jsonl`.
   - Annotate each record with the observed emotional delta and glyph amplitude.
3. **Validate Replay Ordering**
   - Execute the replay verifier against the fresh echo ledger:
     ```bash
     node verify/verify_echo.js echo/ledger.echo.jsonl
     ```
   - Remediate any ordering or checksum faults before continuing the loop.

## 4. Post-Audit Actions

1. **Summarize Resonance Metrics**
   - Generate `echo/summary.rpt.md` capturing drift amplitude distribution, contributor response cadence, and any anomalies.
2. **Update Lineage Log**
   - Append an entry to the main lineage journal referencing the echo audit run ID, stored artifacts, and replay verifier checksum.
3. **Gate for Next Transition**
   - Present the echo findings to the council with recommended thresholds for either Pedagogical Bloom or eventual fossilization.

## 5. Echo Audit Completion Checklist

- [ ] Entropy controls validated and documented.
- [ ] Telemetry harness configured with contributor endpoints.
- [ ] Echo audit loop executed for ≥ 3 cycles.
- [ ] `verify_echo.js` pass recorded with checksum.
- [ ] Resonance summary generated and stored in `echo/summary.rpt.md`.
- [ ] Lineage log updated with echo audit references.

Completing this ritual keeps the drift capsule in a living, observable state while preparing clean telemetry for future transitions.
